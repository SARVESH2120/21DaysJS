                                                             IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)

// The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
// The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.

(function chai(){
    //named IIFE
    console.log('DB connected')
})();

((name)=>{
    //unnameed IIFE
    console.log(name)
})('hitesh');
