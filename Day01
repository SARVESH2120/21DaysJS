Learning JS with Hitesh--

what is meaning different extensions at the end of file??
Js use in backend/mobiles etc...
Node and Deno JS??
Installing Node JS(LTS-- long term support);

node fileName with extension(js)

scope????
Use of only let and const..
Prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope..

const name = "sarvesh";
const title = "gupta";
let titleName;
console.table([name , title, titleName]);


"use strict"; //treat all JS code as newer version

code readability should be high
tc39 and mdn documentation prefer

DataTypes
(Number, Bigint, String, Boolean,
null(standalone value {representation of empty value}),
undefined(declare a variable but doesn't assign a value),
Symbol(unique),
Object
)


console.log(typeof(undefined))
console.log(typeof(null))
